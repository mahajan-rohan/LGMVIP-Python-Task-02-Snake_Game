# 🎮Task 2 Python project: The Snake Game at my internship LetsGrowMore ! 🐍

## 🔍 Project Overview
I've developed a classic Snake game using Python during my programming internship at LetsGrowMore . This project was a fantastic opportunity to enhance my game development skills and deepen my understanding of Python.

## ✨ Key Features:
- Interactive Gameplay: Navigate the snake to eat food, grow in length, and avoid collisions.

- Score Tracking: Keeps track of the current score and high score.

- Dynamic Environment: The game speed increases as the snake grows longer, adding to the challenge.

- Game Over Handling: Displays a game over message and resets the game state for a new attempt.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used:
- Python: The core programming language powering the game.

- Turtle: For creating the graphics and animations.

- Random: To randomly position the food.

- Time: For controlling the game speed.

- Tkinter: For handling the game's window and icon.
